# Gotchacam
a small py program that allows you to start the program and when somebody unarthurised types anything it saves a picture of that person


How to download first of all need a working webcam or else it cant take the picture then you also need python 3.8+ downloed then you can simply open the downloadreq file and the needed req will be downloaded if you dont see any red text/errors your good to go, you can simply open the file to start the program.


How to use you can just press the start button and it will wait for a key to be pressed and then take a picture of the person using the compputer.
This project was made for me to learn python libs and to understand tkinter so if you find any error just tell me and i will fix it

i also added custom logos for the app and a uptime system
